Note: the spec file contains a Requires line that is only used to
trigger an Error from the validator:

%ifarch %ix86
# to cause an expected failure in tests
Requires: libgcc_s.so.1(GCC_x.y)
%endif

This means that the RPM cannot be installed to the Emulator because
that requirement cannot be fulfilled. The application can still be
installed by using the copy-as-binaries method.
